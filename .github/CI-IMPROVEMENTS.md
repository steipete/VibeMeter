# CI Improvements Summary

This document outlines the improvements made to the CI/CD pipeline to address test failures and hanging issues.

## Main Workflow Improvements (`build-mac-app.yml`)

1. **Test Timeout Controls**
   - Added explicit timeout of 15 minutes for test execution
   - Configured per-test timeouts (60s default, 300s max)
   - Disabled parallel testing to avoid concurrency issues

2. **Better Error Reporting**
   - Generate JUnit XML reports for test results
   - Upload both `.xcresult` and `.xml` files
   - Added test summary in failure cases
   - Integrated with GitHub's test reporter

3. **CI-Specific Build Configuration**
   - Added `.xcode-ci-config.xcconfig` for CI builds
   - Disabled code coverage and sanitizers
   - Optimized compilation settings for CI

## New Workflows

### 1. PR Quick Tests (`test-pr.yml`)
- Runs a subset of critical tests for faster PR validation
- ~10 minute execution time
- Tests only core functionality
- Provides quick feedback on PRs

### 2. Test Matrix (`test-matrix.yml`)
- Splits tests into 6 parallel groups:
  - Provider Tests
  - Core Services
  - Multi-Provider Tests
  - UI and State Tests
  - Utility Tests
  - Other Tests
- Each group runs in ~15 minutes
- Better isolation of test failures
- Easier to identify problematic test suites

### 3. Debug Hanging Tests (`debug-hanging-tests.yml`)
- Manual workflow for debugging specific test issues
- Configurable test filters and timeouts
- Captures detailed logs and diagnostic data
- Helps identify MainActor and deadlock issues

## Key Changes to Prevent Hanging

1. **Removed MainActor.assumeIsolated**
   - Replaced with proper async/await patterns
   - Prevents runtime crashes in CI

2. **Disabled Parallel Testing**
   - `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`
   - Prevents race conditions

3. **Added Test Timeouts**
   - Default: 60 seconds per test
   - Maximum: 300 seconds per test
   - Workflow timeout: 15 minutes

4. **Better Resource Management**
   - Single test simulator destination
   - Disabled sanitizers that can cause hangs
   - Optimized build settings for CI

## Usage

### For Regular Development
- Push to main or create PR → Main workflow runs
- PR created → Quick tests run (~10 min)

### For Comprehensive Testing
- Use test matrix workflow for full parallel testing
- All test suites run in parallel (~15 min total)

### For Debugging
- Use debug workflow to investigate hanging tests
- Can target specific test suites
- Provides detailed diagnostic output

## Monitoring

- All workflows report to GitHub's test reporter
- JUnit XML reports for detailed test results
- PR comments with test summaries
- Artifacts retained for 7-14 days
