## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download Vibe Meter** from the [latest release](https://github.com/steipete/VibeMeter/releases)
2. **Install** by dragging Vibe Meter.app to your Applications folder
3. **Launch** and click the menu bar icon to get started
4. **Login** to your Cursor AI account when prompted
5. **Configure** spending limits and currency preferences in Settings

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS 15.0** or later (Sequoia)
- **Cursor AI account** (free or paid)
- **Internet connection** for real-time data sync

## 🎯 How It Works

Vibe Meter connects securely to your Cursor AI account and monitors your monthly usage:

- **Cursor:** Connects securely to your Cursor AI account to monitor your monthly spending.
- **Claude:** Securely reads local log files from `~/.claude/projects/` to track token usage without requiring a login.

- **Automatic Sync** - Updates spending data every 5 minutes
- **Visual Indicators** - Gauge fills up as you approach your spending limits
- **Progress Notifications** - Alerts at 80% and 100% of your warning threshold
- **Currency Conversion** - Real-time exchange rates for accurate international tracking

### 📊 Gauge Behavior

The gauge icon in the menu bar adapts its display based on your usage:

- **No Money Spent** - When you haven't spent any money yet (but have used requests), the gauge shows the percentage of API requests used. For example, if you've used 3 out of 500 requests, the gauge shows 0.6% filled.
- **Money Spent** - Once you start spending money, the gauge switches to show spending as a percentage of your upper limit. For example, if you've spent $15 out of a $30 limit, the gauge shows 50% filled.

This intelligent behavior ensures the gauge always provides meaningful feedback about your usage, whether you're on a free tier using requests or actively spending on premium features.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Spending Limits
- **Warning Limit** - Get notified when you reach 80% (default: $20)
- **Upper Limit** - Maximum threshold for visual indicators (default: $30)
- **Claude Account Type** - Select your account type (Free/Pro) for accurate quota tracking.

### Display Options
- **Show Cost in Menu Bar** - Toggle cost display next to the icon
- **Currency Selection** - Choose from 20+ supported currencies
- **Notification Preferences** - Customize alert frequency and triggers
- **Gauge Representation** - Choose to display total spending or Claude's 5-hour quota in the menu bar.

   ```

4. **Build and run:**
   - Open `VibeMeter.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Select the VibeMeter scheme and press ⌘R

### Key Commands

```bash
# Code formatting
./scripts/format.sh

# Linting
./scripts/lint.sh

# Run tests
xcodebuild -workspace VibeMeter.xcworkspace -scheme VibeMeter -configuration Debug test

# Build release
./scripts/build.sh
```

## 🚀 Release Management

VibeMeter uses a sophisticated release system supporting both stable and pre-release versions with automatic updates.

### Release Types

- **🟢 Stable Releases** - Production-ready versions for all users
- **🟡 Pre-releases** - Beta, alpha, and release candidate versions for early testing
- **⚙️ Update Channels** - Users can choose between stable-only or include pre-releases

### Creating Releases

#### Version Management

Use the version management script to bump versions:

```bash
# Show current version
./scripts/version.sh --current

# Bump version types
./scripts/version.sh --patch        # 0.9.1 -> 0.9.2
./scripts/version.sh --minor        # 0.9.1 -> 0.10.0  
./scripts/version.sh --major        # 0.9.1 -> 1.0.0

# Create pre-release versions
./scripts/version.sh --prerelease beta    # 0.9.2 -> 0.9.2-beta.1
./scripts/version.sh --prerelease alpha   # 0.9.2 -> 0.9.2-alpha.1
./scripts/version.sh --prerelease rc      # 0.9.2 -> 0.9.2-rc.1

# Set specific version
./scripts/version.sh --set 1.0.0

# Bump build number only
./scripts/version.sh --build
```

#### Creating Releases

First check if everything is ready:

```bash
./scripts/preflight-check.sh
```

Then use the automated release script:

```bash
# Create stable release
./scripts/release.sh stable

# Create pre-releases  
./scripts/release.sh beta 1     # Creates beta.1
./scripts/release.sh alpha 2    # Creates alpha.2
./scripts/release.sh rc 1       # Creates rc.1
```

#### Complete Release Workflow

1. **Check Release Readiness:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/preflight-check.sh
   ```

2. **Update Version:**
   ```bash
   # Bump version (choose appropriate type)
   ./scripts/version.sh --patch
   
   # Also increment build number in Project.swift
   # Edit: "CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION": "201" -> "202"
   
   # Commit version bump
   git add Project.swift
   git commit -m "Bump version to 0.9.2"
   ```

3. **Create Release:**
   ```bash
   # For stable release
   ./scripts/release.sh stable
   
   # For pre-release
   ./scripts/release.sh beta 1
   ```

The automated script handles building, signing, notarization, DMG creation, GitHub release, appcast updates, and git commits.

### Update Channels

VibeMeter supports two update channels via Sparkle:

- **Stable Only**: Users receive only production-ready releases
- **Include Pre-releases**: Users receive both stable and pre-release versions

Users can switch channels in **Settings → General → Update Channel**.

#### Automatic Channel Detection

VibeMeter automatically detects the appropriate update channel based on the build type:

- **Beta Downloads**: When users download a beta version (e.g., v1.0.0-beta.5), the app automatically defaults to the "Include Pre-releases" channel
- **Stable Downloads**: When users download a stable version (e.g., v1.0.0), the app defaults to the "Stable Only" channel

This is implemented via the `IS_PRERELEASE_BUILD` flag system:

1. **Build-time Flag**: The release script sets `IS_PRERELEASE_BUILD=YES` for beta builds during compilation
2. **Runtime Detection**: The app checks this flag in its Info.plist to determine the default update channel
3. **Fallback Logic**: If the flag is missing, it falls back to parsing the version string for keywords like "beta", "alpha", "rc"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Flag is set in `Project.swift`: `"IS_PRERELEASE_BUILD": "$(IS_PRERELEASE_BUILD)"`
- Checked in `UpdateChannel.defaultChannel()` method
- Release script automatically sets the environment variable during build

### Pre-release Testing

Pre-releases are perfect for:

- **🧪 Beta Testing** - Get early access to new features
- **🐛 Bug Reporting** - Help identify issues before stable release  
- **📝 Feedback** - Provide input on new functionality
- **⚡ Early Adoption** - Stay on the cutting edge

To participate:
1. Download VibeMeter
2. Go to Settings → General → Update Channel
3. Select "Include Pre-releases"
4. Check for updates to get the latest pre-release

| `preflight-check.sh` | Validate release readiness | `./scripts/preflight-check.sh` |
| `release.sh` | Automated release process | `./scripts/release.sh stable` |
