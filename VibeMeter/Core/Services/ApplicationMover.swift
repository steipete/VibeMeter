/// Service responsible for detecting if the app is running from a DMG and offering to move it to Applications.
///
/// ## Overview
/// This service automatically detects when the app is running from a temporary location (such as a DMG,
/// Downloads folder, or Desktop) and offers to move it to the Applications folder for better user experience.
/// This is a common pattern for macOS apps to ensure they're installed in the proper location.
///
/// ## How It Works
/// The detection uses multiple strategies in order of preference:
/// 1. **DMG Detection**: Uses `hdiutil` to check if the app is running from a mounted disk image
/// 2. **Path-based Detection**: Checks if the app is running from Downloads, Desktop, or Documents folders
/// 3. **Applications Check**: Verifies the app isn't already in /Applications or ~/Applications
///
/// ## Required Entitlements for Sandboxed Apps
/// For full functionality in sandboxed apps, add these entitlements to your app:
/// ```xml
/// <!-- Required for accessing Downloads folder -->
/// <key>com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write</key>
/// <true/>
///
/// <!-- Required for automatic relaunch functionality -->
/// <key>com.apple.security.automation.apple-events</key>
/// <true/>
///
/// <!-- Basic sandbox requirement -->
/// <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
/// <true/>
/// ```
///
/// ## Sandbox Limitations
/// - The `hdiutil` command may fail in strict sandboxed environments, but path-based detection will still work
/// - User will see system permission dialogs when moving from/to certain folders
/// - All file operations require explicit user consent through system dialogs
///
/// ## Usage
/// Call `checkAndOfferToMoveToApplications()` early in your app lifecycle:
/// ```swift
/// let applicationMover = ApplicationMover()
/// applicationMover.checkAndOfferToMoveToApplications()
/// ```
///
/// ## Safety Considerations
/// - Always prompts user before performing any operations
/// - Handles existing apps in Applications folder with replace confirmation
/// - Provides clear error messages and graceful failure handling
/// - Logs all operations for debugging purposes
/// - Only operates when not running from Applications folder already
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
/// Based on proven techniques from PFMoveApplication/LetsMove libraries, using:
/// - `statfs()` for mount point detection
/// - `hdiutil info` for disk image verification
/// - Standard FileManager operations for copying
/// - NSWorkspace for relaunching from new location
